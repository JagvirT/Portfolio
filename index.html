                <p class="description"> Baseball was my first hobby. I started playing at the age of 6 and played all the way until the age of
                    18. I played in all sorts of leagues such as little league, travel ball, and high school ball. Along 
                    with playing in various leagues, I also played every position from pitcher to the outfield. My favorite
                    postion was third base as it is where I had to be the most alert during games as balls were hit hard
                    and fast my way. I played all the way through my senior year of high school, until it was time to go to
                    college. I also enjoyed watching baseball when I was younger and would love to go to watch local teams, 
                    the San Francisco Giants or Oakland Athletics, with my my dad. Some of my favorite memories are going to 
                    the games with my dad and cherished that time to bond with him while also enjoying my favorite sport. </p>

                    <p class="description">At the age of 18 when baseball ended, I picked up a new hobby of going to the 
                    gym daily. I started by going to the gym two or three times a week, then eventually 
                    I settled into a routine of going five days a week. My eating habits also improved as 
                    a result of going to the gym consistently, with diet becoming more nutrious and balanced.
                    By going to the gym consistently I feel myself more confident and mentally focused on 
                    different tasks throughout the week. I prefer to lift weights when I am at the gym but also 
                    run occasionally on the treadmill. Going to the gym also allows me to set goals for myself and 
                    work hard towards achieveing those goals. This a good habit to have for me as it makes me strive
                    to be better in not just the gym but other areas of my life and learn how to be patient in proceses
                    that take time to complete or move forward.

                    <p class="description">When I go out with friends or a group of people, I enjoy playing golf. I particularily enjoy going to
                    the driving range in my hometown of Fremont, as I can just focus of hitting the golf ball as hard and far
                    as I can. Golfing to me is very relaxing and I am able to focus on the sport while also having a good time 
                    with my friends. When we go to the range, I typically will spend a couple of hours and get lost in the 
                    the pleasure I get wiht the sport and the environment around me. I want to the golf course more often and 
                    would like to get a membership to a club one day so I can consistently go whenever I feel like it.
